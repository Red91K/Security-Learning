# Summary
-> cyber is a very complex topic, with a wide range of actors, systems, and stakeholders
-> Cyber is a human problem as much as it is a tech problem - tech alone can't solve cyber
-> cyber is a *process*, not a goal
-> cybersecurity is and will always be a problem because of our increasing dependence on IT, and our human tendency to make mistakes
-> implementing controls will always come at a downside (economic, social, practical, moral)

### Definitions
*Cyberspace*  - Computer Systems + Data
*Cybersecurity* - the process of ensuring the Confidentiality, Integrity, Avaliability of assets in  cyberspace
*Cyberattack* - a malicious attempt by a Threat Actor to compromise the *Confidentiality*, *Integrity*, and/or *Availability* of a computer system
	- *Confidentiality* - information is private
	- *Integrity* - information is accurate
	- *Avaliability* - information is accessible
(See [[CIA Triad]] for more)


# What is Cyber? - Lecture 1
> Cyber evolved from the word **cybernetics**: the field of control and communications theory
> Cyber is a combination of Technology, Human Beings, and Organisations

## Cyber Taxonomy
https://cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/2019-07/Cyber-Taxonomy-101918.pdf
Cyberattacks can be divided into either Disruptive (to disrupt operations) or Exploitive (to gain access to sensitive info)
-> attemps at a taxomony; a systems of classification for any type of cyberattack


## What is Cyber
- "Cyber" evolved from the word *cybernetics*: the field of control and communication theory, whether in *machine or in the animal*
- Cyber is a combination of Technology, Human Beings, and Organisations

### Technology
- Technology that we use, ex: laptops, application servers, networks

### Human Beings
- People who use technology, ex: Criminals, intelligence operatives

### Organizations
- The organisations that have people, ex: nuclear power plants

# What is Security? - Lecture 2
> Cybersecurity is the organisation and collection of resources, processes and structures used to protect cyberspace

What is Security? -> *being more free from danger*
Methods to Achieve Security range from actors
Individual, ex: antivirus
Corporation, ex: Zero Trust Network Architecture, Security Information and Event Managment
Nation, ex: Governance & Public Policy

- Cybersecurity is more than technology; technology is certainly integral to cybersecurity, but cybersecurity includes *resources, processes and structures*
	- ex: governance, architecture
- We need to consider a wide range of things to secure cyberspace
- Cybersecurity is about trying to secure cyberspace in a variety of levels,
	- Individual, state, and even national level

# Demystifying the Cybersecurity Problem - L3
> Our increased dependence on IT is incentivising even more cyberattacks, and also inevitably creating vulnerabilities.
> Given this, cybersecurity is a never ending battle: it is a process, not a goal

> Cyber policy attempts to maximise the benefits of technology, while minimising security risks
> This is incredibly difficult, given the wide range of threat actors, vulnerabilities, and impacts

-> What do we need to be concerned about?
### Examples of Concerns on different Levels
- Individual: What laws should be written for me? 
- Corporations: What liabilities do businesses have in the case of cyberattacks? Can businesses hack back?
- Nation: Is a cyberattack a declaration of war?

The goal of the policy maker is to *take advantage of the benefits* while *minimising the security risks*

### Cyber Policy (examples)
-> The goal of Cyber policy is to maximise the benefits of technology while minimising the security risks

- This is difficult because of the wide range of actors, wide range of security risks, and wide range of impacts
ex: What industries should we prioritise?
To what extent should the government mandate cybersecurity for corporations who hold private data of citizens?

Laws: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
Executive Orders: PPD-41 (National Cyber Attack Corrdination)
Regulations: Do not call registry
Frameworks: NIST framework

### Abstract
**Cyberspace**: artefacts dependent on computing and communications technology 
**Security**: technology, processes, and policies that help mitigate the risk / damage of cyberattacks

Cybersecurity issues arise because:
- Presence of malevolent actors in cyberspace
- Societal reliance on IT systems
- Inevitable presence of vulnerabilities

> Cybersecurity is a ne ver ending battle, and a permanently decisive solution to the problem will not be found in the foreseeable future
- This is because of the *complexity of IT systems* and *inevitable human mistakes*
- Additionally, adversaries & threats to cybersecurity evolve with each advance in cybersecurity technology

> As information technology becomes more integrated into society, the incentives to compromise IT infrastructure grows.
- Cybersecurity is a ongoing process, and there is no 'solution', as much as any other problem such as war, poverty, etc

> However, Improvements to cybersecurity posture do help mitigate the damage of cyber attacks
- A well defended target is far less lucrative to attackers & takes longer & more resources to target-> acts as deterrence

> Two main categories of improving cybersecurity; 
> efforts to implement preexisting cybersecurity standards & guidelines 
> developing new standards for cybersecurity

## Why Care About Cybersecurity?
(Very loose definitions, + a lot of the definitions depend on each other, dependencies in *italics*)
**Cyberspace**: a collection of... 
- artefacts dependant on computing and communications technology,
- information that such artefacts use, store, handle or process
- The interconnections between the two elements

- this space isn't physical or virtual, elements can be physical or on the internet

**Cybersecurity** - security in cyberspace
- technologies / processes that decrease the probability of cyberattacks / mitigate *negative* *impacts* against information technology by a *hostile actor*
	- however, whether a action negative or the actor is hostile is very much subjective, depends on who's perspective we view it from

> Nota Bene, cybersecurity does not limit security to technology. One of the most important lessons that emerge from industry experience is that non-technological factors can have a equal if not greater impact on cybersecurity.

A full evaluation of cybersecurity involves *process* and *polity*
**Process** - how users of information tech use it (get it IT?)
**Policy** - how organisations require users to behave

> The modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a gun. Tomorrow's terrorist may be able to deal more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb. (NRC 1991, Computers at Risk)

The IT that we rely on is mostly created, owned and maintained by the private sector, yet many depend on the government to create policy decisions to address cybersecurity issues. On the other hand, a justification for argument could be that the government is responsible for addressing most societal issues, such as crime, poverty, etc.

### How has Cybersecurity Changed since 1990?
- Change
-> consequence
**Cyberphysical Systems** - physical systems that are controlled by IT

- Drastic increase of computing power -> Problems linked w/ cryptography
- More Integration of IT -> Exploiting vulnerabilities is more lucrative & more vulnerabilities (because of the nature of human fallibility)
- Mobile devices are commonplace -> Enterprises have less control about devices that they (the employees) essentially use
- Privately owned "App stores" -> security assurance for software
- Widespread integration of Cyberphysical systems -> cybercrime can cause physical damage
- Rise of cloud computing (companies outsourcing cloud-based solutions)
	- -> More damage if cloud systems are compromised, lucrative target for attackers
	- -> On the other hand, centralising information (via cloud computing) can make IT easier to secure
	- -> End of the "network perimeter", the cloud depends on access over WAN / internet, remote work means that users access services from anywhere
- Exponential increase in internet users -> more targets, especially those unaware of cybersecurity practices
- Rise of social networking -> actors could take advantage of trust relationships, social engineering

## Barriers to CyberSec
- **Cost** - Improving cybersecurity posture comes at a high cost, a cost which many corporate and government executives neglect in favour of other issues 
	- Cybersecurity is often dismissed as a improbable risk at the most, slowing down the progress of implementing and updating cybersecurity policy
- **Innovation** - how should we balance securing new technologies and at the same time ensuring that innovation can continue at a high rate?
	- There is an inevitable tradeoff of innovation whenever we implement security measures. 
	- For instance, security standards can increase the cost of development & time required for small scale developers, increasing the bar of entry, thus dissuading new developers from joining the market & decreasing the rate of development
- **Civil Liberties** - measures that increase cybersecurity posture can often infringe upon the rights of individuals, for instance privacy, free speech, due process, etc
	- Ex: [[CISPA]] (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act) grants immunity from prosecution to corporations that share consumer data with the government (Bill was introduced in 2011, vetoed -> reintroduced in 2013)
	- Under CISPA, any company could obtain the information of individuals and share it with any third parties and the government, *under the condition that* it was to improve cybersecurity posture.
	- Critics of the act saw it as a infringement on privacy and civil liberties, citing how CISPA has very little limits on what information can be shared with the government, and that it allows the government to spy on individual citizens
	- Additionally, some say that the term "cybersecurity purpose" is very much vague and not clearly defined. Such ambiguity over the very conditions that justify privacy infringement is concerning. 
		- However, CISPA actually does provide a somewhat concrete definition of what such purpose pertains to - they define shareable information as information *"that directly pertains to a threat to, or vulnerability of a system or network."* 
		- They also define "cybersecurity purpose" as
> the purpose of ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of, or safeguarding, a system or network, including protecting a system or network from—
		- a vulnerability of a system or network;
		- a threat to the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of a system or network or any information stored on, processed on, or transiting such a system or network;
		- efforts to deny access to or degrade, disrupt, or destroy a system or network; or
		- efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network, including to gain such unauthorized access for the purpose of exfiltrating information stored on, processed on, or transiting a system or network.

Such term does not include the purpose of protecting a system or network from efforts to gain unauthorized access to such system or network that solely involve violations of consumer terms of service or consumer licensing agreements and do not otherwise constitute unauthorized access.

 - Even if a company could technically have a skewed interpretation of what constitutes as a threat / vulnerability, the fact that they will have to prove this in front of a court of law likely diminishes this possiblity.
	- (My opinion) In my opinion, companies have almost zero incentive to harm the consumer if it does not come with other benefits. (ex: economic) Given this, I am not aware of any such benefits that could be obtained by extracting the Personal Identifying Information (PII) of consumers. 
	- I am not denying the fact that PIIs could be used by companies to target consumers, many of whom lack proper cybersecurity awareness and thus would be incredibly vulnerable. 
		- However, given that a exponentially higher number of PIIs are not only stored by private corporations but also leaked by data breaches targeting such corporations justifies CISPA. 
		- Additionally, I want to reemphasise that given that companies could face serious lawsuits if caught mishandling consumer data and that they have almost no incentive to do such a action, the drawbacks to CISPA in terms of individual privacy are minimal
	- However, it should be noted that the CISPA was amended on April 2012, after facing heavy opposition to exclude the intellectual property provision, and again later to *hold the government and corporations liable* if it violates any of CISPA's restrictions 

# The Threat Landscape - L4
> The Threat Landscape is incredibly complex
> There are a wide variety of actors, with varying skill levels, motivations, and TTPs
> We have a huge attack surface, with varying levels of importance, security, etc
> We have a wide range of systems at stake, from small businesses to critical infrastructure

<u>When we talk about cyber as a security problem, what are we actually talking about?</u>
- To understand cybersecurity, we need to understand a *wide array of topics*

## internet
- Includes 
	- devices(phones, computers, sensors)
	- physical infrastructure (fiber optic, routers)
	- logical structures (network protocols, encryption protocols)
	- applications (software we use)
	- governance (who is responsible for the above?)

## hackers
<u>Different <em>motives</em></u>, Ex: curiosity, financial, political
<u>Varying <em>levels of skill</em></u> , but increasing in size, scale, and severity
<u>Different <em>targets</em></u>, control systems, infastructure
<u>Different <em>actors</em></u>, hacktivists, criminals, hobbyists

> there will be no "cyber armageddon", rather more specific, targeted attacks

## effects
- how do you measure the scale? 

## attack surface
- IT networks are scaled and complex, personal & public systems are intertwined
-> Attributing attacks are difficult

# Challenges - L5
> Implementing Security is a significant challenge due to the complex and nuanced nature of the Threat Landscape and the Attack Surface of many organizations
<u>Wide range of targets </u>
- should specific sectors be protected more?

<u>Wide range of actors</u>
- how do you attribute a attack to another nation?
- penalties?

<u>Wide range of attack vectors</u>
- does the government have the obligation to reveal backdoors?

<u>Diverse attack surfaces</u>
- should companies use cloud infrastructure? 

# Avast 2020 Threat Landscape Report
## PC
### Email-based Malware
- In the last decade, malicious email spam (**malspam**) was the primary way that malware was distributed
	- ex: Emotet - Trojan malware, 
		- Homeland Security designated as most costly malware ($1m per incident), 
		- mainly spread through email spam, 
		- contains detection / analysis prevention methods (ex: vm machine detection)
	- ex: SMTP hacks
		- attackers can use stolen SMTP credentials to carry out social engineering attacks
-> Emails will continue to be the primary method for spreading malware, however methods will become more sophisticated 

### Exploit kits
**Exploit kits** are programs that allow unsophisticated threat actors to carry out automatic, scripted attacks

Most often, Exploit Kits exploit vulnerabilities in web browsers to install malicious payloads
- Exploits vulnerabilities in browsers to deliver payload without any necessary user interaction
- Exploit kits are often hosted in legitimate websites that have been compromised

1. User is redirected to *landing page*, checks for vulnerabilities that can be exploited
2. Then, the *gate* (essentially just a piece of code) evaluates if the user should actually be targeted
	1. This is where anti-detection / analysis measures come in place, ex: checks if the system is in a virtual machine
	2. Ex: checking for OS, geographical location, etc

- such kits are being offered on a rent basis, 
-> allows attackers to carry out attacks with little technical knowledge
- ex: RIG
	- Embeds malicious code into iframe, redirects user to RIG landing page
	- Downloads Adobe Flash (SWF) file, when the file is opened drops Grobios Trojan
	- Contains multiple detection / analysis prevention measures;
		- uses api hashing to obfuscate the names of API function calls
		- checking if payload is being run in a vm
-> Expect a increase in the usage & sophistication of exploit kits

### Supply chain attacks
**Supply chain attacks** target a external service provider that has access to the target's systems, and uses it to carry out attacks

**APT** (Advanced Persistent Threats) are attackers that establish a illicit, long-term presence on a system in order to mine data / carry out attacks

### RDP exploits
**RDP** (Remote Desktop Protocol) - protocol developed by microsoft, provides GUI to connect with another computer via a network connection (listens @ port 3389)

- In the past few years, cybercriminals have abused weak RDP credentials and even used social engineering to carry out attacks
- RDP vulnerabilities exist, allowing attackers to penetrate even well-secured systems (ex: BlueKeep)
-> Expect cybercriminals continue to abuse RDP and RDP vulnerabilities

## Mobile
### Subscription Scams & Fake Apps
**Subscription Scams** - charging a higher price for subscription plans than advertised, often without prior notice (broad definition because there are many different types)
**Fake Apps** - "fake" apps posing as their real counterparts
-> Expect rise in both

### IOS Jailbreaks
-> Expect more Jailbreaks & the impact associated with them

## IOT
### Increase in IOT devices
-> Expect devices to "get smarter", collect even more data 
-> IOT devices are a increasingly more lucrative target for cyberattacks
-> Widened attack surface for IOT devices

### Sophisticated IOT malware
- cybercriminals are realising the potential of IOT-targeting malware
-> Expect criminals to add sophisticated defences to their malware, such as obfuscation, analysis prevention measures, etc

### RCE exploits
**RCE** (Remote Code Execution) - allows a attacker to remotely execute code on a computer
Ex: SQL injection can be used to inject malicious code, and then the code will be remotely executed
**Botnet** - network of hijacked computers that are remotely controlled by a attacker
RCEs create Botnets

-> As new smart devices are introduced into the market, new vulnerabilities will arise, increasing the number of RCE attacks
-> Makes Botnets even easier to build

### Botnet Infrastructure
- "state of the art" botnets are using p2p / DNS-HTTPS communication protocols, making them harder to detect
-> expect increased usage of botnets

## AI
### Privacy will become the new frontier of security
**Differential Privacy** - a way of publicly sharing information about a dataset without leaking individual information, by adding noise to the raw dataset when a query is made
-> expect AI algorithms to enhance privacy, ex: differential privacy
-> at the same time, note that AI is a major driver in the loss of privacy

### Data ownership
- hope to see ways that allow users to control their own data


# Cyber Incidence - L6
Examination of two cyberattacks, and how they differ from each other.

## Monde TV 5 (Jan 23, 2015)
- Defacement of TV5Monde website, the attack shut down network
- $5.6 milion in damages, nearly destroyed the channel
- Unknown motives & actors (originally thought to be ISIS, now fingers are pointing to Russia

## TSMC Cyberattack (August 2018)
- A TSMC onsite operator did not follow TSMC's SOPs (Standard Operating Procedure), forgetting to scan a piece of hardware before connecting it to TSMC's network
- The device contained the WannaCry worm, and this spread through TSMC's network
- The worm was discovered, and it knocked TSMC's network offline 
-> 3 percent revenue shortfall (2018) = $5.2 Billion dollars
- example of Supply Chain Induced Risk

# Practical Questions
<u>To what extent should the government have access to private information?</u>
- Is there a difference if national security is involved? What about criminal cases?

<u>Should governments use cyber tools to engage in Asymmetric forms of warfare?</u>
- Should there be international agreements on cyberwarfare standards?

<u>Is cybersecurity a private, local, state, or federal problem?</u>
