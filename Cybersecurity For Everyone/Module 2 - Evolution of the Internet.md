# Summary
**Internet** - global communications network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardised communications protocols to exchange data

-> The conceptualisation, development, and scaling of the internet was a collaborative process that was driven by academic inspiration, government support, and private sector support
-> 6 stage process
1. Academic inspiration *conceptualises* the internet, and a connected society
2. Government support creates the *first prototype* of the internet - ARPANET, a packet switched network
3. Standardisation of Ethernet draws *private sector interest* -> *Feedback loop* of internet development and private sector interest
4. By handing the reigns of internet development over to Private Sector, US government facilitates scaling & development of Internet
5. Creation of the WWW opens up internet to everybody
6. Today, the internet is a *Global Commons* that is the backbone of today's society

## Why learn this?
-> Many of the communications protocols that we use to this day were created when the internet was still in it's infancy
-> By examining the context in which these foundational protocols were developed and the initial visions of these protocols, we can better understand the benefits and limitations of such protocols
-> By examining mistakes, changes, and continuities in internet development, we gain valuable insights that can aid future internet development
ex: Securing AI by design?

# L1 - Academic Inspiration and a World Changing Idea
## Summary
- The development of the internet was a evolutionary process. 
- The first step of this journey happened by the late 1960s, when we conceptualised a packet-switched WAN.
-> As such, academic inspiration laid the foundations for the internet.

? - How did we get *here*?
- Billions of connected devices
- Petabits of traffic per second
- Dependence on Internet

## Overview of Week
1. Development of internet was a *step-by-step, evolutionary process*
2. Many players contributed to its development
	1. <u>Academic Inspiration</u> laid *foundations*
	2. <u>Government support</u> & <u>Private Sector ingenuity</u>* drove development*

## Key Questions to Ask
- How did we exponentially *expand* the internet in terms of *scale, performance, and higher order functionality?*

- How did we *distribute the concept* of the internet, before it was implemented?

- How did a *diverse, geographically distributed* group of people *collaborate* to build the internet?

- How did a *conceptual model* turn into a technology that now acts as the *backbone of society*?

## Origins - Academic Inspiration
-> By the late 1960s, academic inspiration has conceptualised the internet, and a vision of a interconnected society
1. Interconected Devices
2. Packetized data
(later) -> First WAN connectivity

1961, MIT
-> Packet switching won over traditional circuit networks

1962, MIT
-> vision of a "Galactic Network", where interconnected networks would allow users to access information and services from around the world 

1969, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)
3. A prototype network (ARPANET) connecting a computer in Massachusets to another in California

## Forward Challenge: Prototyping
- How do we distribute this concept?
- How do we turn this great idea into some kind of prototype?
- How do we get the necessary resources to do all this?

# L2 - Governement Support and Prototyping
## Summary
- Government support (DARPA) helped build ARPANET: the first packet-switching network in history, which acted as the first prototype of the internet.
	- TCP/IP was developed along ARPANET
	- At that time, we envisioned a very limited number of networks - max 256!
- ARPANET was built on a few values:
1. Each network should stand independently
2. Traffic is routed to a central node, who forwards packets
3. best effort communication
4. no central authority

-> Thus, Government support enabled a conceptual model to come to life

## ARPANET Timeline
- Research of networking technology continue through mid-1960s
- 1968, DARPA funds ARPANET
- 1969, first computers connected under ARPANET
	- UCLA, Stanford, UCB, U of Utah
-> ARPANET demonstrates that *packetised* data could be transferred over a *WAN*, between *interconnected* computers
- TCP (*transmission*) & IP (*addressing*) are developed with ARPANET
- researchers in the 60s envisioned a world with <u>only a handful </u> of networks -> designed ARPANET for a maximum of *256* networks

## INTERNET...?
-> originates from **'internetwork'**
- communication between independent devices, by *interlinking* multiple *independent networks* together

### Foundations of the 'Internetwork'
1. each network should *stand on its own*
2. *best-effort* communication - expects data loss during transmission, so check for data loss & re-transmit
3. all traffic is routed to a *central node*, connecting the network to other networks
4. there is no *central authority* of the internetwork

## Applications of ARPANET
-> used for only a few, but groundbreaking applications
1. FTP, replaced having to physically transport floppy disks
3. Telnet, replaced having to travel to access computing resources
6. Email, more accessible form of long-distance communication

## Forward Challenge: Scaling
- How do we *expand the use* of ARPANET, and have it *complement contemporary technologies*?
- Can ARPANET extend beyond a academic endeavour and *provide value* to businesses?


# L3 - Private Sector Support & Moving the Internet Out of the Lab
-> Initial standardisation of networking tech (Ethernet) triggers a positive feedback loop, 
more open source, collaborative development -> more interest & adoption -> ;;
(+) internet facilitates collaboration

-> The creation of Ethernet, a standardised networking protocol boosts Private & Public Sector adoption of Networking technology
-> This brings together many brilliant communities in developing the internet
-> development of the internet is collaborative, open source
-> development happens through a feedback loop, more development -> more interest

## Standardisation Increases Adoption
-> with the success of ARPANET, new ad-hoc(non-standardised) networks develop
- but by 1970, Ethernet is developed by Xerox as a standardised network protocol
-> This standardisation boosts private & public sector interest in Networking, 

## Private & Public Sector Adoption
- Computer systems integrated into businesses
- Development of early personal computers
-> Networking technology rapidly develops to reflect this interest, ex: DNS

## Development is Collaborative
- as more Private & Public sector adoption, many brilliant communities converge to develop internet
- as Networking technology grows, protocol specifications are made public & open-source
- development of the internet is *collaborative*, open-source -> this accelerates development
- to this day, many working groups are collaborating to further develop the internet


# L4 - Privatising and Scaling the Internet
## Summary
- Changes such as the end of ARPANET, the adoption of TCP/IP happen because the status quo of internetworking goes against the decentralised vision of the internet
	- Universal adoption of TCP/IP in 1984 marks the birth of the internet
- By handing the reigns of the internet to the private sector, US gov't paves the way for *1st internet boom* - large-scale private-sector investment in internetworking tech
- Still, US government continues to support advanced research that paves the way for *2nd internet boom* - the WWW

## Status Quo - 1980s
-> Changes such as end of ARPANET, adoption of TCP/IP happen b/c status quo of internetworking goes against decentralised vision

- By 1980s, "inter networking" has become more popular
- Several purpose-built networks, ex: NASA
- variety of protocols exist -> challenges to adoption
- ARPANET is still the "connective tissue" between individual networks
-> Goes against broader vision of independent, decentralised communication
! something interesting - decentralised vision was b/c threat of nuclear attack, Government wanted a disaster-proof communications network

-> TCP/IP universally adopted in 1984 -> Standardisation of network protocol marks birth of internet
+ TCP/IP is a "dumb" standard, chosen over many "smart" standards
	+ *"dumb"* network - network offers simple services, sophisticated end-user devices
	+ decentralsed
	-> encourages end-user innovation
	ex: TCP/IP, simple forwarding of packets, sophisticated services using TCP/IP
	
	+ *"smart"* network - network offers sophisticated services, dumb end-user devices
	+ centralised
	-> innovation depends on central authority
	ex: telephone network, intricate network, dumb phones

## Privatisation
-> By handing the reigns of the internet to the private sector, the US government paves the way for the *1st internet boom*

- US Government pulls itself out of centralised networking position
- National Science Foundation restricts high speed network to governmental research
-> Encourages private sector to scale & develop internet
-> Leads to *1st internet boom* - large private sector investment into internet technology

## Government Support
-> Still, Government plays a key role
-> Government Support of advanced research lays the path for the *2nd internt boom* - the WWW
- *Supercomputer Network Study Act* - allocates $600 million for high performance computing
- *Mosaic* - first web browser created in government lab

# L5 - Building the World Wide Web
## Summary
-> Creation of WWW rapidly accelerates user base of internet, now the internet is not just used by businesses but by everyday people

## Background
- By the end of 1980s, 
	- networking tech is standardised, ex: TCP/IP
	- Advanced research in networking tech
	- private sector interest in internetworking
-> paved way for WWW

## Rise of WWW
- Tim Berners Lee comes up with the concept of the *WWW* - information sharing system featuring webpages that can be linked to each other
- Ease of access leads to fast adoption of WWW
- WWW becomes dominant way to utilize the internet
-> 350 million users by 2000

## Browser competition
- MOSAIC becomes most popular Web Browser
- MOSAIC team forms Netscape
- MS creates Internet Explorer
-> Intense competition between Netscape and MS

# L6 - The Internet as a Global Commons
## Summary
- Today, the internet is truly a global commons
- Internet continues to develop in a positive feedback loop between increasing technology & adoption
- Cloud Computing & Mobile are two key areas of development 

## Developments
-> positive feedback loop between developing internet technology & increasing user base
- Continuously growing user base of WWW
- Introduction of Home Wifi routers
- Monetisation of Advertisements
- *Web 2.0* - interactive, dynamic webpages 
	-> Web becomes more and more ingrained into daily life
	-> Rise of SNS
- Greater demand for websites drives two trends:
	- Cloud Computing
	- Mobile Computing

## Cloud Computing
- We diverged from large computers & time-sharing devices a long time ago, to personal computers
- But, in 2006 - we come back to sharing compute resources under the paradigm "Cloud Computing"
-> Accessibility of compute resources drives technological innovation

## Mobile Computing
- By end of 2000s, faster 3G networks allow for greater speeds
- In 2007, Apple introduces iPhone

## 2010s
-> The internet becomes a global commons
- Growing Connectivity - IOT, Mobile
- Social Connectivity - SNS


## 2020s
-> societal reliance on technology
- Advanced Analytics - AI, Data Science,
- Critical Infrastructure dependant on internetworking
- Autonomous vehicles & smart cities

## But why are we learning about all this?
- Understanding history allows us to prevent costly mistakes
- Many of the protocols & architectures we use to this day were developed 40~50 years ago
-> With our knowledge of what went wrong with these protocols, we can examine our current protocols to make them more secure
