## Framing Effects
> We know that hacking is the process of attempting actions to produce an end effect. 
> 
> But how do we frame the end effects that hacking generates?

-> We can divide effects into 3 catagories

->  broadly, each effect leads to another (Primary -> Secondary -> Second Order), reflecting the cascading nature of the effects that cyberattacks generate

**Primary** - Effects to (directly targeted) IT Systems
**Secondary** - Effects to the Enterprise
**Second-Order** - Effects to Society

Needless to say, cyber attacks range in the severity of effects they produce
## Primary Effects
- Effects on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of **directly targeted IT systems**
- Can be divided into 2 categories:
	- **Disruptive Effects** (integrity & avaliability) - making systems **inoperable or less effective**
		- Defacement - making the victim's ability to communicate less effective
		- Internal (launched from internal systems) & External Denial of Service
		- Data Attack (wiping, encryption, manipulation)
		- Physical Attack
	- **Exploitative Effects** (confidentiality) - **stealing data**
		- sensor data (ex: CCTV, PoS sensors, etc)
		- stored data (PII, records, Intellectual Property)
		- data in transit
		- credentials
## Secondary Effects
- Effects on the **targeted organization's** processes & capability
-  Impacts include
	- **Lost Revenue** due to halt in provision of goods or services
	- **Remediation Costs**-repairing devices, hiring IR teams, overtime costs
	- **Reputational Costs** - share price drops, lost customers, etc

## Second-Order Effects
- Effects on society
- Impacts Include
	- **Physical Impacts** - ex: water from dam floods local town
	- **Macroeconomic** - ex: TSMC hack impacts smartphone production
	- **Perceptional** -ex:shakes confidence in industry
- Policymakers should look at the significance of second-order effects to answer the question of "What cyber events constitute a public problem rather than a private one?"--a question integral to cyber governance
