# Key Takeaways

# The Intelligence Lifecycle
| Step | Description | Examples / Componenents |
|-|--| -- |
| **Direction** | Set **goals** for the rest of the cycle.  | Define stakeholders, collection sources, intelligence requirements. |
| **Collection** | **Collect data** from a variety of internal and external sources. | Collect logs from security appliances, subscribe to threat data feeds, collate relevant threat reports |
| **Processing** | **Process raw data** into a format suitable for analysis, often with extensive automation | Transform list of IOCs into .csv, translate dark web communciations, ingest log data into visualization software|
| **Analysis** | **Interpret information** to answer intelligence requirements. Analysis should be concise, relevant to a specific audience, and include reccomended courses of action. | Evaluate source reliability, use reasoning, formulate & test hypotheses, use analytical models, etc.  |
| **Dissemination** | **Deliver intelligence** to relevant stakeholders in the most appropriate format | Long-form reports, short-form memos, presentations, visualisations.|
| **Feedback** | **Collect feedback** from stakeholders and analysts on the efficiency of each stage of the intelligence cycle. | Identify oversights in direction, gaps in collection, inefficiencies in processing, mistakes in analysis, missed audiences in dissemination. |


# People, Processes & Tools
- Just like Threat Actors use TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to compromise the security of organizations, defenders can use PPTs (People, Proceesses, and Tools) to improve security.
- As much as tools are invaluable for accelerating parts of the intelligence cycle (especially collection, processing & disseminaition), at the end of the day intelligence analysis is a fundamentally **human process**. Stages like direction, analysis, and feedback require extensive human expertise.
