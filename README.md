# Security-Learning
-> A compilation of notes and key takeaways for security-related courses I took. 
- All of the courses are great resources for learning about security (+ most of them are free!)
- the Resources.md file contains links to all the publically avaliable courses
- Each course has a brief description & summary as well as comprehensive notes for each section
